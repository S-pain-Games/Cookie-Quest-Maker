Welcome to the Github repo of Cookie Quest Maker

## Brief guide of how to play our Alpha

### Controls:
You can move your character freely with mouse clicks on Pc or by tapping on your screen on the mobile phone version.

### First Day Guide:
1. Whenever you approach to a NPC, a dialogue window will display showing a little conversation. After that, you will start a story.
2. On the back of the bakery, there is an oven and a table.
3. In the oven you can bake cookies that you can then use in the table.
4. On the table you can "build" a quest for you cookies using the pieces in your storage. (The cookie is the only piece that is consumed in the process)
5. You have to select a story, then open your storage and select a piece, then you can drag and drop the piece in the correct spot to create a quest.
6. A quest must have atleast a cookie, action and a target to be valid.
7. Once you have made a quest for all the stories that day, you can close the bakery.
8. At night you will be presented with two individuals, speak to the left one to enter the cookie recipes shop.
9. Once you exit the shop the next day will start and you can speak with the NPC to hear the outcome of your choices and to start a new story

## Roadmap

- [ ] 2-3 Customers in the bakery that start stories per day (The system is in place for this but we have to write stories)
- [ ] Extra background customers that make the bakery more lively
- [ ] Gain currency when completing stories and more shopping options
- [ ] Map of the Town to see the state of each location
- [ ] All Quest pieces will be baked with simple ingredients that can be bought or adquired in conversations
