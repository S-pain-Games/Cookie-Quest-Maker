# Cookie-Quest-Maker


 ##A brief guide of how to play our Alpha  

- You can move your character freely with mouse clicks on Pc or by tapping on your screen on the mobile phone version.  
- Whenever you approach to a NPC, a dialogue window will display showing a little conversation. After that, you will start a story.  
- On the back of the bakery, there is an oven and a table.
- In the oven you can bake cookies that you can then use in the table.
- On the table you can "build" a quest for you cookies using the pieces in your storage. (The cookie is the only piece that is consumed in the process)
- You have to select a story, then open your storage and select a piece, then you can drag and drop the piece in the correct spot to create a quest.
- A quest must have atleast a cookie, action and a target to be valid.
- Once you have made a quest for all the stories that day, you can close the bakery
- At night you will be presented with two individuals, speak to the left one to enter the cookie recipes shop.
- Once you exit the shop the next day will start and you can speak with the NPC to hear the outcome of your choices and to start a new story

 ##Functionality to be expanded
- 2-3 Customers in the bakery that start stories per day (The system is in place for this but we have to write stories)
- Extra background customers that make the bakery more lively
- Gain currency when completing stories and more shopping options
- Map of the Town to see the state of each location
- All Quest pieces will be baked with simple ingredients that can be bought or adquired in conversations
